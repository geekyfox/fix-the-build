## Before Enlightenment, Fix the Build

This repository contains my non-fiction book called "Before
Enlightenment, Fix the Build," in which I'm aiming to make spirituality
accessible for software engineers. The canonical location for it is
https://geekyfox.net/fix-the-build, so that's where you can read it.

This book is released under the [CC0 public domain
license](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/). So, if you
want to make your own thing on top of what I wrote, sure thing, go
ahead and do whatever you want. Needless to say, I'll be glad to offer
my opinion and generally hear back from you.

## Why GitHub?

GitHub is not an obvious place to put a philosophy-ish / self-help-ish
book, so let me explain.

Firstly, "Before Enlightenment, Fix the Build" is closer to what you
can call a textbook than a blog. It's a series of essays that build up
on each other, and it's written to be read in order, at least for the
first time.

I considered using the likes of SubStack or Medium for this project,
but then I realised that I'll have to put a "this is a chapter
seventeen from an ongoing series, and you'd better start with chapter
one" warning at the beginning of every post, which is lame. Well, that,
or I'll have to rework those essays into stand-alone pieces, which
means padding the text with build-ups and recaps that would annoy
someone reading it as a textbook. Choices had to be made, and a
textbook it is.

Secondly, it represents the fundamental impermanence of this text. It's
not a prophecy, it's not a scripture, it's a notebook of a practitioner
who learned a few things along the way and took the effort to write
them down. If I learn something that clarifies or invalidates things
I've written about before, I'll just push a new commit, and that's how
it works here.

One day, I'll depart this plane of existence and move on to what's
next. On that day, whichever version is the latest will become the
final. Until then, it's all work in progress.

I hope you'll like it.
